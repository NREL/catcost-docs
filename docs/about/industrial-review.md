# Industrial Review

The development of CatCost has been informed by thorough review with a team of industrial catalysis experts having extensive knowledge of catalyst synthesis and process economics. All members of the review team had experience in catalyst synthesis and many were selected for their knowledge in catalyst scale-up and industrial process design. Notably, the assembled members included senior members from the global petrochemical refining sector, the global catalyst manufacturing sector, and academic and industrial catalyst design and development, as well as consultants from these industries. This diversity of expertise generated feedback both on the validity of the underlying logic for catalyst estimation and the usability and implementation of these methods. The team provided guidance on the state-of-technology for publicly available cost estimators, the methods employed by CatCost, and the usability of the spreadsheet-based CatCost tool.
