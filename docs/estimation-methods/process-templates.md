# Process Templates for the Step Method and CapEx &amp; OpEx Factors Method

## Making estimates faster and more accessible

Many users of CatCost are not expected to have the experience in industrial chemistry or the access to process simulation tools, such as AspenPlus, needed to generate a detailed synthesis process design at industrial scale. Furthermore, even for experienced users, developing such a design may involve sizing 10–30 pieces of equipment with materials of construction, performing materials and energy balances, and undergoing optimization and revision to obtain a credible process design, a significant effort that may require days or weeks to complete. For this reason, CatCost-provided process templates are included in both the Step Method and the CapEx &amp; OpEx Factors method for processing cost estimation. These templates are based on complete process models and have been entered in CatCost for easy selection by the user. We expect that this will aid both casual users or non-engineers who may have difficulty developing such designs on their own, and power users for whom the process designs will be an excellent starting point that they can then customize for greater accuracy and specificity. The bundled process templates were chosen to encompass the largest potential user-base and minimize the required user input to generate accurate estimates for the largest number of potential catalysts.

## Step Method templates

Templates in the step method consist of selected process steps (e.g., spray dryer) with alternates for different production scales in order to accommodate the entire 1–1000 ton range of step method order size (Figure 8.1). Twelve different step method templates are included in CatCost, and the user can easily select from among them or enter a custom process as shown in Figure 8.2.

**Figure 8.1.** Screenshot of CatCost showing an exemplary step method process template: Production of an FCC catalyst at &quot;Small&quot; (1 ton/day) scale. Steps in green are not available at all production scales, so formulae automatically select the correct unit for that production scale for inclusion.

## CapEx &amp; OpEx Factors templates

Process templates in the CapEx &amp; OpEx Factors method include a list of equipment items including size, quantity, and material of construction for a specified production scale of catalyst (see Figure 8.3 for an example of a process template equipment list and Figure 8.4 for the overall selection of a process template from the list), as well as a list of utilities consumption per mass unit of catalyst (see Figure 8.5).
