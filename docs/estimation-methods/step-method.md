# Processing Costs via a Simplified Step Method: The _3a Step Method_ Module

## Overview and _3a Step Method_

_NOTE: In CatCost v1.1.0, the Step Method is included in the Excel version only. It will be added to the web version in a future release._

The step method included in CatCost uses a simplified approach to processing cost estimation, in which all capital and operating costs associated with a particular process step (e.g., spray dryer, rotary vacuum filter, extruder) are captured in a single hourly cost at a specified production scale. This includes ancillary equipment for a process unit, such as pumps and motors. This approach is both attractive in its simplicity and highly relevant to real industrial conditions, as it is based on the procedures used by contract manufacturers of catalysts to provide price quotes for their services. The step method assumes that existing process equipment at a contract manufacturer (toller) is used to produce the catalyst, in contrast to the CapEx &amp; OpEx Factors Method described later. The step method can be used on its own to assemble a complete synthesis process in CatCost, or as a way to rapidly add a step to an existing process design in the CapEx and OpEx Factors Method.

The **3a Step Method** module is quite simple. The user can choose a process template from a list of over 10 (described in Chapter 8) or enter a custom process. If entering a custom process or editing a process template, the user simply selects process steps from the available list. Some process steps will not be available at the synthesis scale (Small, Medium, or Large) that has automatically been chosen for the user-entered order size on **1 Inputs**; CatCost will suggest an alternate step in those cases. For each step, the tool will then automatically look up the correct hourly cost for each step and compute the campaign cost and cost per unit of catalyst. For more details on the basis for the Step Method, see the following sections or read the full publication.TODO(ref 13)

## Background

The production costs for a novel catalyst may be estimated rapidly using a step-based method in which individual processing steps, corresponding to specific process equipment used by a contract manufacturer of catalysts, are selected from an established list. This estimation method and the names and costs of individual steps are based upon those used by contract catalyst manufacturers to provide price quotes for their paid manufacturing services. Each step corresponds to a process equipment unit at a particular scale and includes all capital and operating costs, such as equipment purchase, maintenance, operating labor, and utilities. A step-based approach to estimating the cost of catalyst manufacture enables researchers with minimal process design experience to successfully execute an estimate using an appropriate list of process equipment units that approximate a laboratory-scale synthesis.

For example, consider a synthetic chemist who has developed an improved catalyst synthesis that is based on an existing process, but requires an additional reaction step that has been successfully executed at the laboratory scale in a small autoclave. Determining the cost of the new process at industrial scale including this additional step would previously have required working with an engineer who can properly size the reactor for large-scale production and price any new materials needed. The engineer would determine the cost to operate this reactor in an existing plant of appropriate size and provide the chemist the cost of new materials and the new production step (e.g., $0.10/kg product). The researchers then determine whether the improved quality/performance or yield of catalyst achieved by adding this step is justified and, if so, proceed with developing a proposal for management approval. The step method detailed herein simplifies this process by providing a pre-determined list of common process steps for catalyst order quantities in the range of 1–1000 tons. This method can then be used by a researcher or team that does not have access to process design expertise, or with greater speed and accuracy by a team that does.

## Preparing a Step Method Estimate

### Inputs

A price estimate using the step method requires information on both the catalyst synthesis (Synthesis Inputs) and the market or application it will be used in (Business Inputs), as shown in Figure 6.1. This discussion will begin with Synthesis Inputs, which are based on a lab-scale synthetic procedure developed by the researcher or obtained from the literature.TODO(ref 14)

The step method presented herein relies on the assumption that the synthetic procedure translates readily into steps that are well known by the catalyst manufacturing industry.

### Synthesis Inputs

The Synthesis Inputs include catalyst composition and preparation stoichiometry, raw materials consumption and pricing, and synthetic steps. Composition, preparation stoichiometry, and materials pricing are obtained as described above. Finally, the selection of industrially relevant process steps using the step method is conducted to complete the cost estimation.

The laboratory-scale synthetic procedure to prepare the catalyst serves as the basis for translation into industrially relevant process steps. A list of process steps and associated hourly costs for process equipment units commonly used in commercial catalyst synthesis is provided in Table 6.1. A user of the step method begins by selecting steps from this list that correspond to the synthesis steps used for their material at lab scale. Price estimates for three catalysts including Pt/C, Ni/Al2O3, and a modern fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst based on ultrastable zeolite Y (USY) were assembled using steps from Table 6.1 and are discussed below as part of the validation of the step method.

### Business Inputs

For an accurate estimate, the Synthesis Inputs must be coupled with Business Inputs that consider the effect on price of intended catalyst use. The key business input to the step method is order size, which depends on knowledge of the catalytic application including catalyst charge, lifetime, order frequency, and any other factor affecting catalyst demand. In this way, the accuracy of the step method depends on testing15 and technoeconomic analysis information on the catalyst and its application. In general, an economically viable catalyst will have a lifetime of at least 6–12 months, but because it is common practice to run multiple reactors in parallel and stagger catalyst replacement, the catalyst order frequency may not be equivalent to catalyst lifetime. A typical non-precious metal containing catalyst would be ordered twice per year. Catalysts containing gold, silver, or a platinum group metal (PGM) are typically ordered four times per year to minimize the cost of on-site and in-the-loop catalyst inventory.16 From all this information the order size and frequency can be determined for the catalyst of interest. If ordering the catalyst from a contract manufacturer, the customer would provide this order size and frequency to the contract manufacturer or toller, who would then develop a pricequote for a synthesis &quot;campaign&quot; to produce each order. In the step method described here, only the order size, in the range of 1–1000 tons, is needed to determine a price.

A step size (in tons/day) and campaign length can then be determined based on the desired order size. Determining the campaign length starts with selecting a synthesis scale, because a contract manufacturer has existing equipment at specific scales to choose from. These scales are defined here as Small (1 ton/day), Medium (10 tons/day), and Large (150 tons/day). The Small scale is used for 1–5 ton orders, the Medium scale for 5–70 ton orders, and the Large scale for 70–1000 ton orders. Determining the campaign length is then as simple as dividing the order size (tons) by the appropriate production scale (tons/day) and adding time for cleaning (0.5 days for Small; 1 day for Medium/Large). Standard protocol in the industry dictates that equipment is clean at the start and end of each campaign. Cleaning time is charged at the same rate as operating time because the requirements (operators, utilities, etc.) are similar. This entire process is depicted graphically in Figure 6.2.

**Figure 6.2.** Step size (bottom, ton/day) and campaign length including cleaning (top, days) as a function of order size (tons), assuming 24-hour operation. Cleaning time is 0.5 days for Small and 1 day for Medium/Large.

### Total Campaign Cost, Overhead, and Selling Margin

Having determined the production scale and campaign length, the hourly production cost is then calculated. Using the list of steps selected from Table 6.1 at the appropriate production scale (Small, Medium, or Large), the corresponding hourly costs are then added to determine a total hourly operating cost for the entire process. The costs in Table 6.1 are inclusive of all operating and capital costs including operating labor, maintenance, utilities, etc., and were determined through discussions with industry experts as well as literature review.17 The costs have a mid-2017 basis assuming production in the United States. For escalation of these costs to other estimate basis years, the **ChemPPI** library is used. Note that because all the process equipment used in a synthesis is devoted to that customer&#39;s order throughout the campaign including cleaning, the hourly cost is constant for each unit/step. For steps in Table 6.1 that are not available at a particular production scale (e.g., a spray dryer at small scale), the alternative step suggested in the Substitute column may be selected instead. Using a 24-hour day, the daily production cost can then be calculated and multiplied by the campaign length in days to determine a total production cost for the next step in the catalyst price estimation process.

The final step of developing a catalyst price estimate using the step method is to add overhead costs and a selling margin. The raw materials and synthesis step costs are first added together as a subtotal. Then General and Administrative (G&amp;A) costs are calculated as 5% of this subtotal, and Sales, Administrative, Research and Distribution (SARD) of 5% of both the subtotal and G&amp;A.4,8 Note that distribution entails loading the product on a dock at the catalyst production site; the customer pays the freight. For the purposes of a step method estimate, the selling margin can be considered solely as a function of the order size. In the corresponding author&#39;s experience with commercial catalyst manufacture, a single relationship between the selling margin and order size applies to a large majority of catalyst types, including but not limited to supported PGM, supported base metals, and metal oxides. As the order size increases, the margin decreases from ca. 33% of the selling price (50% of pre-margin costs) at the 2-ton scale to ca. 8% of the selling price at the 1000-ton scale, following a linear relationship between the logarithms of order size and margin (Figure 6.3). Note that the raw materials costs are generally included in the overhead and selling margin calculations because the contract manufacturer assumes the expense and risk of procuring the raw materials to meet the specifications and timeline of the catalyst purchaser. However, the costs of any noble metals would be excluded from the overhead and margin because they are provided by the catalyst user&#39;s pool account or offset by recoverable metals content.16

## Step Method Demonstration and Verification with Market Price Data

### Catalyst Price Assessment: Pt/C

Using the procedures described in the previous section, the following example demonstrates the execution of the step method to estimate the price of a 2 wt. % Pt/C catalyst. This estimate uses the assumption of a precious metals pool account that is managed separately,16 so the value of platinum content is excluded.

As described in the Synthesis Inputs section, the first step to estimating the price of the Pt/C catalyst is to determine the raw material requirements, catalyst composition, and synthesis method from the laboratory-scale procedure. In this example case, a researcher seeks to estimate the price of a 2 wt. % Pt/C catalyst that is prepared by wet impregnation of an activated carbon support with chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6). The price for the chloroplatinic acid does not include the value of Pt; it includes only the price of converting Pt metal to H2PtCl6 via oxidation in _aqua regia_ because of the pool account assumption mentioned above. In this procedure, a slurry of the Pt precursor and carbon is chemically reduced by the addition of hydrazine (N2H4) at 50 C. Because the reaction liberates HCl upon reduction, the reaction vessel is fitted with a sodium hydroxide scrubber. The Pt/C material is then filtered and dried at 90–­95 C to remove 50% of the moisture and yield the final catalyst. This procedure was used to populate the raw materials requirements (lb/lb catalyst)shown in Table 6.2. Based on the lab-scale procedure, the industrial-scale process equipment units selected from Table 6.1 include incipient wetness, multistep reactor, scrubber, plate and frame filter, simple reactor, and rotary dryer (40–100 °C).

Proceeding to Business Inputs, the envisioned application of the Pt/C catalyst is a large-scale slurry hydrogenation plant with a hypothetical 8 ton/year catalyst demand. In order to minimize the value of Pt in the precious metals loop (i.e., to reduce inventory),16 an order frequency of 4 orders per year was assumed, giving an order size of 2 tons. Using this order size and the relationships illustrated in Figure 6.2, the Small (1 ton/day) scale was selected and the campaign length was determined as 2.5 days, including cleaning. A total campaign cost ($23,400/campaign), not including materials, overhead, or margin, was then calculated by multiplying the step cost total ($390/hr, $9360/day) from Table 6.1 by the campaign length (2.5 days).

Adding the raw materials and synthesis campaign costs gives a subtotal of $16.55/lb catalyst, as shown in Table 6.2. The final step of developing a catalyst price estimate using the step method is to add overhead costs and a selling margin. As described above, G&amp;A (5% of subtotal), SARD (5% of [subtotal + G&amp;A]), and selling margin (50% of [subtotal + G&amp;A + SARD] at the 2 ton scale) are added to yield an estimated selling price of $27.37/lb for this Pt/C catalyst.

### Comparison of Three Step Method Catalyst Estimates to Market Prices

Following the procedures outlined in the previous section for 2 wt. % Pt/C, price estimates were developed for 21 wt. % Ni/Al2O3 (at 20-ton scale) and a USY-based FCC catalyst with rare earth content (at 200-ton scale). The Ni/Al2O3 order size was based on a fixed bed reactor (catalyst charge of 10 tons) with an expected catalyst life of 6–12 months; this first order is intended to fill the reactor and have a spare charge. The FCC catalyst order size was based on 5 ton/day catalyst feed rate at a typical refinery, with 100 days of inventory. The components of these estimates are shown in Table 6.2 along with the Pt/C estimate. The step method-based estimates using the mid-2017 step costs for the three materials compare favorably with market price data,18 also from mid-2017 in the US, within ± 20% relative to the market prices.
