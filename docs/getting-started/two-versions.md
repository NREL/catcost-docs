# Two Versions of CatCost

Two versions of CatCost are available, both of which use the same estimation logic and overall organization into modules and libraries. These versions include a [spreadsheet](/getting-started/spreadsheet) based on Microsoft Excel (Office 365 version / Excel v16 recommended; tested on Excel 2011 and 2013) and a [web app](/getting-started/web-app) that uses a web browser and does not require any software installation. The focus of the Excel version is customization and editable estimation logic, while the focus of the web version is ease of use and powerful visualizations. The web tool is written in JavaScript ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and built with modern web technologies (e.g., Node JS, Node Package Manager (NPM), JavaScript Package Manager (JSPM), Aurelia, Bulma, and Babel). Interactivity is added through the combination of modern data binding, an event-driven user interface, and charts designed with D3 and the Plotly API.

**Spreadsheet version – key advantages:**

- Calculation logic can be viewed and customized
- Printable Outputs view for meetings and publications
- Excel estimates can be converted for use in the web app using the [Data Tools](/getting-started/data-tools), allowing the user to gain the benefits of both

**Web app version – key advantages:**

- Easy to use interface
- Visualizations of cost components and sensitivity
