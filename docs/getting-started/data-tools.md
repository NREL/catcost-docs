# CatCost Data Tools

You can convert estimates and libraries from the [spreadsheet](/getting-started/spreadsheet) version of CatCost to JSON files that can be imported into the [web app](/getting-started/web-app) version. 

## Install the Data Tools

Download a ready-to-use executable or the Python source code at the CatCost Data Tools [Releases](https://github.com/NREL/catcost-data-tools/releases/latest) page.

## Converting an Estimate or Library

To convert an estimate, launch the data tools application (or follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/NREL/catcost-data-tools/) to run the application using Python). Select the type of conversion you want to perform (Estimate, Materials Library, Equipment Library, or Spent Catalyst Library), select the Excel (.xlsx) file containing the information you want to convert, and choose a destination for the JSON file to be created.

## Importing the JSON File

To import the JSON file output by the Data Tools into the web app, see the [File menu](getting-started/web-app?id=the-file-menu) instructions for the web app.
